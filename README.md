SQL Portfolio

# 👋 Hi! I'm Kari 👩🏽‍💻 — Welcome to My SQL Portfolio

This is my growing collection of SQL practice and mini-projects. I'm currently completing a Data Analyst course, and this repo documents my journey as I level up in SQL — one query at a time.

## 📘 What You'll Find Here
- 📊 Practice queries using real-world-style datasets
- 🧠 Clean, well-commented SQL focused on clarity and logic
- 💡 Projects where I break down what I'm doing and why

## 🔍 Why I Built This
I'm naturally curious and love digging into data to find patterns, trends, and outliers.  
This portfolio helps me apply what I’m learning, track progress, and share my process with others.

## 🚀 What’s Next
- Learning advanced SQL joins, subqueries, and window functions
- Using SQL with Python and visualization tools
- Continuing to build real-world projects
